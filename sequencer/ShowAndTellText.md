At each Show and Tell, up to 3 people take the FabLab stage to to present their current project, product, build, innovation, prototype, an insurmountable problem, half-baked solution, slick technique â€“ whatever they think is worth sharing. Our communal goal is to challenge them, give feedback, offer advice, and of course, praise their work and courage. Drinks and networking while and after.
