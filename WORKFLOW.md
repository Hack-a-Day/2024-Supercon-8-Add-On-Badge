Steps needed to get to WORKSHOP

- DONE: revise the schematic
	- green wires = hardwired, blue wires = need to wire on protoboard
	- made sure LEDs are wired ACTIVE LOW (to match how the sequencer works)
- DONE: adapt the code to match the schematic
- DONE: finalise the mechanics of (at least) one SAO
- URS: clean up and finalise code in repo
- URS: iterate on mechanics and how the devices sound (one using vibro motor)
- MITCH: plan a layout for the protoboard that allows for all three options (vibro, solenoid, buzzer)
    - electronics and all wiring on bottom side, 3D printed sounding-device and 2 x LEDs on top side 
- GRAHAM: test one channel of the breadboarded sequencer with our finalised SAO
- GRAHAM: solder-up one SAO, following the layout we planned and document
- GRAHAM: solder-up two more types of SAO - have someone do it from documentation - and test all three with sequencer 
- GRAHAM: plan workshop syllabus
- test the sequencer/badge combo running off 2xAA batteries
- DONE: buy closed jumper blocks from BerryBase
- get hold of a badge in advance of the workshop (Mitch to e-mail)
- test again in full with the actual badge

- assemble equipment:
