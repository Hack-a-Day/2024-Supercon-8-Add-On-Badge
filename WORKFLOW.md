Steps needed to get to 

- DONE: revise the schematic
	- green wires = hardwired, blue wires = need to wire on protoboard
	- made sure LEDs are wired ACTIVE LOW (to match how the sequencer works)
- DONE: adapt the code to match the schematic
- finalise the mechanics of (at least) one SAO
- plan a layout for the protoboard that allows for all three (vibro, solenoid, buzzer)
- test one channel of the breadboarded sequencer with our finalised SAO
- solder-up one SAO, following the layout we planned
- solder-up the other two types of SAO, following the layout we planned
- plan workshop syllabus
- test the sequencer/badge combo running off 2xAA batteries
- buy closed jumper blocks from BerryBase
- get hold of a badge in advance of the workshop (Mitch to e-mail)
- test again in full with the actual badge

- assemble equipment:

# Workshop Syllabus

Duration: 2 hours

- Pick your
- Solder
- CH32V003 SWIO Flashing (2 laptop, 2 debuggers)
- Standalone test?
- Badge 

# Considerations

- adjust the number of sequencer steps or tie notes?
- detect petals by address?

# Equipment List

- soldering iron kits - how many
- laser cut signage
- 42 poster roll-up
- fablabnk promo materials
