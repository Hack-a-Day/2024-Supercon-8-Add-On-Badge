Steps needed to get to WORKSHOP

- DONE: revise the schematic
	- green wires = hardwired, blue wires = need to wire on protoboard
	- made sure LEDs are wired ACTIVE LOW (to match how the sequencer works)
- DONE: adapt the code to match the schematic
- DONE: finalise the mechanics of (at least) one SAO
- DONE: buy closed jumper blocks from BerryBase
- DONE: clean up and finalise code in repo
- URS: iterate on mechanics and how the devices sound (one using vibro motor)
- DONE: plan a layout for the protoboard - electronics and all wiring on bottom side, 3D printed sounding-device and 2 x LEDs on top side 
- DONE: solder-up one SAO, following the layout we planned
- DONE: solder-up two more types of SAO - have someone do it from documentation - and test all three with sequencer
- MITCH: make step-by-step images of how to assemble in KiCad
- GRAHAM: test three SAO's with the breadboarded sequencer
- GRAHAM: plan workshop syllabus
- GRAHAM: test the sequencer/badge combo running off 2xAA batteries
- GRAHAM: sequencer button documentation

# Workshop Syllabus

Duration: 2 hours

    - About us/Mitch/42/FabLab and project history (RVPC)
    - Demo of one sound badge
    - Show where flashing guide and CH32V003/sequencer code lives
- Get started w/ soldering introduction and support                         [1 hour]
    - First task: Solder the jumper, resister and LED
    - CH32V003 SWIO Flashing - one-by-one as they go
    - Follow slide presentation accumulating components on the layout
- Choose your variant (motor type and sound maker) and assemble             [20 minutes]
    - 1. Cymbal hitter - w/ vibro spinning motor
    - 2. Rattle - w/ cell buzzer motor OR vibro spinning motor
    - 3. Spinning ball tom - w/ vibro spinning motor
- Standalone test with own badge                                            [10 minutes]
- Join the badge orchestra                                                  [15 minutes]
- Flashing using RPi Pico                                                   [optional extra]
- Intro to the CH32V003 or sequencer code                                   [optional extra]

To do in advance
- mass print of 3D printed parts
- precut lengths of solid core (red, yellow, orange, black - Urs)
- 1 bag per participant (generic parts only)
- motors on the side: pre-wired

# Monday
# Wednesday - get hold of the badge and test from 20:30
# Friday

# Considerations

- adjust the number of sequencer steps or tie notes?
- detect petals by address?

# Equipment List

- soldering iron kits - how many
- laser cut signage
- 42 poster roll-up
- fablabnk promo materials
