# Satisfying-Senseless-Sonic Add-On (SSSAO) Workshop Notes and Questions

## Q: What is Thonny? A: A Python IDE for beginners

## I2C Basics

- Two wire:
    - SDA (Serial Data) for bidirectional data transfer
    - SCL (Serial Clock) for synchronization
- Supports multiple devices on a single bus, with each device having a unique address
- Acknowledgment (ACK) mechanism to confirm successful data transfer
- Communication consists of start and stop conditions, address frames, and data frames

## Q: What is Pico's badge pin layout?

## Badge Spec

Raspberry Pi Pico W with Wifi and Bluetooth

SAO Pinout:
1 GPIO1 (P1)
2 GPIO2 (P2)
3 SDA
4 SCL
5 +V 
6 GND

2 x I2C buses, one going to left side of badge, one going to right
- I2C0 on pins 1 and 2 (goes to SAO pinouts 1, 2 and 3 on left side of badge)
- I2C1 on pins 31 and 32 (goes to SAO pinouts 4, 5 and 4 on right side of badge)

Raspberry Pi Pico W - I2C devices have a unique address, and the rest of the functionality is handled by as if they were memory-mapped peripherals. What does this mean? If you want to ask the touch wheel where your finger is, you simply query its memory location 0. To set the LED colors, you write bytes to memory locations 15, 16, and 17 for red, green, and blue, respectively. Each spiral arm of the LED matrix petal is simply a byte in memory â€“ write to it and the blinkies blink.

I2C devices place bytes to a location in the Pico's memory

## Code Example (Micropython)

https://github.com/fablabnk/2024-Supercon-8-Add-On-Badge/blob/main/software/software/main.py

This example
- blinks the LEDs on the petal SAO on startup
- start a loop which:
    - displays the state of the badge's A, B and C buttons as RED, GREEN, BLUE
    - reads the state of the touchwheel bus
    - activate the petal LEDs based on state of the touchwheel

Variables are setup in:
https://github.com/fablabnk/2024-Supercon-8-Add-On-Badge/blob/main/software/software/boot.py

Most importantly:
- PETAL_ADDRESS is set to 0x00

- set petal_bus to None
- try petal_init(i2c0)

- look for LED petal on I2C0 bus (left side)
- look for LED petal on I2C1 bus (right side)

## What would a Musical Proto Petal look like?

It works independently of the main badge
Imagine a button and a pot, where
- Holding the button activate

## How would sequencing our proto petals work in practice?

Let's call our Proto Petals PR1-6 and give them unique addresses, as follows...
PR1: 0x4A
PR2: 0x4B
PR3: 0x4C
PR4: 0x4D
PR5: 0x4E
PR6: 0x4F

Note that: 0x00 - 0x07 and 0x78 - 0x7F are reserved addresses

Mutable Grids? With three-button interface?
